Proper balance eliminates wheel and tire vibrations that are annoying, can reduce traction in certain circumstances and cause increased tire and suspension wear.\n\n**Brake caliper**\n\nThe hydraulic assembly that contains the brake pads and applies them against the brake rotor to slow or stop the car.\n\n**Brake shoes**\n\nCurved metal platforms faced with a friction material that is pressed against the inside of a brake drum to slow or stop the car. Brake shoes are applied by the wheel cylinder.\n\n## C\n\n**Cold cranking amps (CCA)**\n\nA rating that indicates the amount of power a battery can provide for engine cranking in cold-start conditions.\n\n**Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)**\n\nan automatic transmission that uses two variable-diameter pulleys and a steel belt to continuously alter its gear ratio. This provides smooth power delivery and allows the engine to operate at the optimum speed for any given driving condition.\n\n**Crankcase (engine block)**\n\nLargest assembly of an internal combustion engine. Consists of the lower part of the engine which contains the crankshaft, connecting rods and pistons in an oil-tight housing.\n\n**Curb weight**\n\nThe weight of a vehicle carrying a full tank of fuel but no passengers or cargo.\n\n## D\n\n**Drive shaft**\n\nOn rear-wheel or all-wheel drive vehicles, the shaft that couples the transmission to the rear axle differential assembly.\n\n**Dual overhead camshafts (DOHC)**\n\nAn engine with two camshafts located in the upper portion of the cylinder head.\n\n## E\n\n**Engine block (crankcase)**\n\nLargest assembly of an internal combustion engine. Consists of the lower part of the engine which contains the crankshaft, connecting rods and pistons in an oil-tight housing.\n\n## F\n\n**Fast idle**\n\nAn increased idle speed that typically occurs for a short time after a cold engine start to improve drivability and speed engine warm up.\n\n## G\n\n**Grab**\n\nBrakes engage suddenly and strongly, even when applying light pressure on the brake pedal.\n\n**Green House Gas (GHG)**\n\nAny gas in the atmosphere that absorbs and emits radiation within the thermal infrared range, thereby contributing to climate change/global warming. The primary greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere are water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone.\n\n## H\n\n**Hesitation**\n\nMomentary loss of power on acceleration.\n\n**Horsepower**\n\nThe measurement of the engine's ability to produce work.\n\n## H\n\n**Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV)**\n\nA vehicle that achieves improved fuel efficiency by using an electric motor to help the engine propel the car. The motor receives power from a modestly sized battery that is automatically recharged during vehicle operation using a generator driven by the car’s engine. The battery is also recharged by “regenerative braking” that turns the electric motor into a generator during coasting and braking. HEVs have no provision to connect an external charger, and the energy contained in the battery can propel the vehicle under electrical power alone for only a very short distance, if at all. The Toyota Prius is an example of an HEV.\n\n## M\n\n**Multi-point injection**\n\nA fuel delivery system that utilizes a fuel injector for each cylinder.\n\n## P\n\n**Positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) valve**\n\nEmission control system that redirects crankcase vapors back into the engine to be burned. Often controlled by a PCV valve that requires periodic replacement. PCV valve problems can cause a car to run rough, stall, use excess engine oil, smoke, and have high exhaust emissions.\n\n**Power loss**\n\nEngine runs at reduced speed or requires more throttle to maintain constant speed.\n\n**Pull**\n\nVehicle self-steers to one side or the other when driving or braking.\n\n## R\n\n**Rain-sensing wipers**\n\nWindshield wipers whose rate of operation is electronically controlled based on the amount of moisture on the windshield.\n\n**Rear view camera**\n\nA camera mounted at the back of the vehicle that displays a picture on a screen in the dash or rear view mirror of what is behind the car when the transmission is in reverse.\n\n**Rear-wheel drive (4X2)**\n\nDrive system that provides power to only the rear wheels of the vehicle. In trucks, this type of powertrain is sometimes referred to as “4X2” in comparison to a four-wheel drive “4X4” system.\n\n## R\n\n**Rough idle**\n\nWhen the engine vibrates or shakes while running with the drivers foot off the gas.\n\n## S\n\n**Specific gravity**\n\nTerm used in connection with testing a battery’s electrolyte. A specific gravity test is used to determine the battery’s state of charge. Sealed “maintenance free” batteries sometimes have an indicator on top that indicates the state of charge.\n\n**Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV)**\n\nAn enclosed body on a truck chassis that provides ruggedness and ground clearance with room for up to 9 passengers and their cargo. These vehicles usually have fuel economy and ride/handling traits similar to the trucks on which they are based. The Chevrolet Tahoe/Suburban, GMC Yukon/Yukon XL and Ford Expedition/Expedition are common SUVs.\n\n## T\n\n**Thermostat**\n\nA component that helps regulate engine temperature by controlling the speed at which coolant circulates through the engine.\n\n**Transaxle**\n\nUsed in front-wheel drive and rear-engine, rear-wheel drive vehicles.

Managers also report that the need to accommodate higher density workloads is a less pressing concern than rising costs and the need for greater energy efficiency. While 65% of operators are at least somewhat concerned about their ability to accommodate rising densities, most are currently planning to meet the need for denser IT infrastructure by limiting their efforts to specific areas of their data halls.\n\nCompared with 2023, other response categories show little change. About two-thirds of managers are at least somewhat concerned with forecasting future data center capacity requirements, a lack of qualified staff, and energy performance for IT and facilities equipment.\n"""

In other words, if a field has multiple dependent fields that are independent from one another, it can lead to redundancies that violate 4NF rules.\n\n**Anti-caching**\n\nAnti-caching is a strategy that can be used when data is not found in the faster in-memory cache and must be retrieved from slower, persistent storage. The technique involves aborting the transaction and kicking off an asynchronous operation to fetch the data from the slower medium to memory. The transaction can be retried later and the information will be ready to served from memory.\n\n**Authentication**\n\nAuthentication is an action that validates an identity. In computing and databases, authentication is mainly used as a way to prove that the person or process requesting access has the credentials to validate that they can operate with a specific identity. In practical terms, this might include providing an identity (like a username) and associated authentication material (such as a password, a certificate or key file, or a secret generated by a hardware device belonging to the person associated with the identity). Authentication is used in conjunction with authorization to determine if a user has permission to perform actions on a system.\n\n**Blue-green deployments**\n\nBlue-green deployments are a technique for deploying software updates with little to no downtime by managing active traffic between two identical sets of infrastructure. New releases can be deployed to the inactive infrastructure group and tested independently. To release the new version, a traffic routing mechanism is switched to direct traffic from the current infrastructure to the infrastructure with the new version. The previously-active infrastructure now functions as the target for the next updates. This strategy is helpful in that the routing mechanism can easily switch back and forth to roll backwards or forwards depending on the success of a deployment.\n\n**Cache-aside**\n\nCache-aside is a caching architecture that positions the cache outside of the regular path between application and database. In this arrangement, the application will fetch data from the cache if it is available there. If the data is not in the cache, the application will issue a separate query to the original data source to fetch the data and then write that data to the cache for subsequent queries. The minimal crossover between the cache and backing data source allows this architecture to be resilient against unavailable caches. Cache-aside is well-suited for read-heavy workloads.\n\n**Collation**\n\nCollation in databases refers to the ordering and comparison characteristics of different character systems. Most databases allow you to assign collation settings, which impact how text in the system are sorted, displayed, and compared against one another. Collation is often defined using a set of labels that describe the character set, language context, and different options about sensitivity or insensitivity to capitalization, accents, and other character modifiers.\n\n**Column**\n\nColumns are a component of table-oriented databases that label and potentially define the type of each value stored in that column. In traditional relational databases, the properties of a series of columns are one of the primary ways of defining the properties of the table in general. Each row added to the table must provide values that conform to the requirements associated with the table's columns. In non-relational databases, columns can have many different properties. Generally, however, they are used to label and define the characteristics for values that records choose to store in that column.\n\n**Concurrency**\n\nConcurrency is the ability of a system to work on multiple tasks at once without affecting the overall result. Concurrency allows systems to execute operations in parallel, increasing the relative performance of the group of tasks.\n\n**Connection pooling**\n\nConnection pooling is a strategy used to improve performance and avoid connection exhaustion by managing the connections between an application and database. It does this by maintaining a pool of connections to the database. By keeping the connections open and reusing them for multiple queries, the application can forgo the overhead of having to establish a connection each time and the database's connection limits can be managed by pooling component.\n\n**Dark launching**\n\nDark launching is a deployment and release strategy that helps organizations test new changes in production contexts without affecting the user experience. Dark launching involves releasing new code in parallel to the original functionality. Requests and actions are then mirrored and run against both the old code and the new code. While the system's behavior from the user's perspective is only affected by the original code, the new code can be tested with real data to validate functionality and catch performance and functional problems. When properly vetted, the application can be altered to use the new code path exclusively.\n\n**Data definition language (DDL)**\n\nA data definition language, or DDL, is a set of commands or actions that are used to define database structures and objects. They are a key component to relational and other databases and are expressed as a subset of the available commands available to manage data in languages like SQL. Data definition language is the portion of the language dedicated to describing, creating, and modifying structures and the frameworks that will hold data.\n\n**Database**\n\nA database is a structure used to organize, structure, and store data. Databases are often managed by a database management system which provides an interface to manipulate and interact with the database and the data it manages. Databases can be highly structured or allow more flexible data storage patterns and can store many different types of data in a way that allows for querying, recalling, and combining data at the time of retrieval.\n\n**Database abstraction layer**\n\nA database abstraction layer is a programming interface that attempts to abstract differences between underlying database technologies to provide a unified experience or interface to the application layer. Database abstraction layers are often helpful for developers because they help to normalize the implementation differences between various offerings and can stay stable even as the underlying technology evolves. However, there are some challenges as well, such as leaking abstractions, masking implementation-specific features or optimizations from the user, and creating a dependency that can be difficult to dislodge.\n\n**Dataset**\n\nA dataset, sometimes spelled data set, is a single collection of data. Typically, this represents a chunk of related data applicable to a certain task, application, or area of concern. Typically, datasets are a combination of the data itself as well as the structure and context necessary to interpret it. They often consist of a combination of quantitative and qualitative values that can act as the raw data for further analysis and interpretation.\n\n**Document**\n\nIn the context of document databases, a document is considered a container for information representing a single record or object containing related descriptive data. Documents can have a flexible structure that does not have to match the other documents on the system and can often be nested. Documents are typically represented in a data serialization format like JSON or YAML that can organize the document with labels and metadata.\n\n**Document database**\n\nA document database is a database model that represents items in individual objects called documents. While documents can be grouped together for organization, they don't have to share the same structure and can be designed to uniquely capture the data required to describe the item in question. Document databases typically don't support robust join operations to link different documents together, but are often praised for their flexibility and quick time-to-productivity due to their flexibility and ease in representing programmatic data structures.\n\n**Expand and contract pattern**\n\nThe expand and contract pattern is a strategy for introducing new changes to a database schema without affecting existing applications. It works by introducing changes in carefully controlled stages by first adding new or changed structures alongside existing structures and then expanding the application logic to use both structures simultaneously. Eventually, after testing, the application can stop writing to original structure and it can be removed.\n\n**Extract-transform-load (ETL)**\n\nExtract, transform, and load, often abbreviated as ETL, is a process of copying and processing data from a data source to a managed system. First the data is extracted from its current system to make it accessible to the destination system. Next, the data is manipulated and modified to match the requirements and format of the new system. Finally, the reconstructed data is loaded into the new system.\n\n**Full-text search**\n\nFull-text search describes a family of techniques and functionality that allow you to search the complete text of documents within a database system. This is in direct opposition to search functionality that relies only on metadata, partial text sources, and other incomplete assessments. Full-text search relies on asynchronous indexing using natural language-aware parsers to analyze and categorize text within documents.\n\n**Key**\n\nIn the context of databases, a key is any attribute, column, or group of attributes or columns that can be used to uniquely identify individual rows. Some pieces of data can be used as a key because of their natural uniqueness (a natural key) while other data sets may need to generate a key to identify each record (a surrogate key). Each table or data collection can have multiple keys that uniquely identify a row (called candidate keys), but typically, there is a main key (called the primary key) designated as the main way to access rows.\n\n**MariaDB**\n\nMariaDB is an open-source relational database system developed with the goal of providing a drop-in replacement for MySQL after Oracle's acquisition left some within the community uncertain about the future direction of the project. Since its initial fork, each project has added features that widen the gap between the two database systems.\n\n**MongoDB**\n\nMongoDB is the most popular document-oriented NoSQL database system in use today. It stores data using JSON-like structures that can be specified at the time of data storage. Each document can have its own structure with as much or as little complexity as required. MongoDB provides a non-SQL methods and commands to manage and query data programmatically or interactively. MongoDB is known for its fast performance, scalability, and for enabling a rapid development pace.\n\n**NewSQL**\n\nNewSQL is a descriptor for a category of more recent relational database offerings that attempt to bridge the gap between the structure and well-ordered guarantees of a relational database system and the high performance and scalability associated with NoSQL databases. While NewSQL is a fairly loose categorization, it is generally used to refer to databases that allow SQL or SQL-like querying, transaction guarantees, and flexible scaling and distributed processing.\n\n**NoSQL**\n\nNoSQL databases, also sometimes called non-relational or not only SQL databases, are a broad category that covers any type of database systems that deviates from the common relational database model. While non-relational databases have long been available, the category generally is used to refer to newer generations of databases using alternative models like key-value, document-oriented, graph-oriented, and column family stores. They generally are used to manage data that is not suited for the relational model with a heavy focus on flexibility and scalability.\n\n**PostgreSQL**\n\nPostgreSQL is a popular, high performance relational database system known for its compliance to various SQL standards. PostgreSQL focuses on providing a single, flexible database engine instead of offering multiple engines for different use cases. It is highly extensible and has a great range of community additions and client applications.\n\n**Query language**\n\nA query language is a type of programming language that specializes in searching for, retrieving, and manipulating data in databases. SQL, or Structured Query Language, is the most common querying language in the world and is used primarily to manage data within relational database systems. Query language operations can be categorized based on the focus and target of the procedure into Data Definition Language (DDL) when they are used to define data structures, Data Control Language (DCL) when they are used for system management tasks, and Data Manipulation Language (DML) when they are used to modify data.\n\n**Read operation**\n\nA read operation is generally defined as any operation that retrieves data without modification. Read operations should generally behave as if the underlying data were immutable. They may modify the retrieved data to change its format, filter it, or make other modifications, but the underlying data stored in the database system is not changed.\n\n**Replication**\n\nReplication is a process of continually copying and updating data from one system to another system. In databases, this typically involves a server sharing a log of changes that other servers can read and apply to their own copies of the data. This allows changes to propagate between various servers without requiring each server to approve operations at the time of execution. Many types of replication exists that differ in terms of method of sharing, the architecture of which systems copy data from where, and what policies are in place to control the replication process. Replication is an important feature in many systems for maintaining data availability, distributing load, and providing copies of data for offline procedures like backups.\n\n**Serial scanning**\n\nSerial scanning is a search technique that involves analyzing each potential item against the query at the time of the search. This is in opposition to index-based searching where items are accounted for and organized ahead of time to allow for faster query response.\n\n**SQL**\n\nSQL, or Structured Query Language, is the most common database querying language in use today. It is primarily used to work with relational data and allows users to create queries to select, filter, define, and manipulate the data within relational databases. While SQL is a common standard, implementation details differ widely, making it less software agnostic than hoped.\n\n**Standard column family**\n\nA standard column family is a type of column family database object that stores data by defining row keys that are associated with key value pairs akin to columns. Each row can define and use its own columns, so the resulting dataset is not regular as with relational database tables. However, the row keys combined with column labels and values still somewhat resembles a table. Standard column families offer good performance for key-based data retrieval as they are able to store all of the information associated with a key in the same place and can modify the data structure for that key easily.\n\n**Storage engine**\n\nA storage engine is the underlying component in database management systems that is responsible for inserting, removing, querying, and updating data within the database. Many database features, like the ability to execute transactions, are actually properties of the underlying storage engine. Some database systems, like MySQL, have many different storage engines that can be used according to the requirements of your use case. Other systems, like PostgreSQL, focus on providing a single storage engine that is useful in all typical scenarios.\n\n**Table aliases**\n\nA table alias is name given at query time for an existing or calculated table or table-like database object. Table aliases can be useful if the original name is long or ambiguous or if the table is generated by the query itself and requires a label to refer back to it in other parts of the query or for display.\n\n**Transaction**\n\nA database transaction is a set of operations combined into a single unit that can be executed by a database system atomically. Transactions ensure that all of the operations within them are successfully completed or that they are all rolled back to return to the starting state. This helps preserve data integrity and allows for isolation between different unrelated actions that clients may make within a database. The guarantees provided by database transactions are summarized by the ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability) properties.\n\n**Two-phase commit**\n\nTwo-phase commit is an algorithm used to implement transactions in distributed systems. Two-phase commits work by separating the commit process into two general stages. In the first stage, a potential change is communicated by the server that received it to a coordinating component. The coordinator requests a vote from all of the involved servers on whether to commit or not. If the vote succeeds, the second stage begins where the transaction is actually committed by each individual member. The algorithm allows distributed systems to maintain a consistent dataset at the expense of the overhead associated with coordinating the voting procedure.\n\nDefinitions are simplified for general understanding.\n\nSpecific use cases may require further clarification.\n\nPage 2 of 5\n"""

Engine coolant prevents freeze-up in winter, raises the boiling point in summer, and protects the cooling system from rust and corrosion year round.\n\n**Battery**\n\nThe component that stores the electrical power needed to start the engine. The battery also powers vehicle accessories when there is insufficient power output from the charging system, and acts as a “shock absorber” for the vehicle electrical system.\n\n**Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV)**\n\nA car without an internal combustion engine that is powered exclusively by electricity stored in a large onboard battery pack. Most of today’s BEVs have a range of about 60-100 miles. An exception is the Tesla Model S which comes with a choice of several larger battery packs that offer an estimated 140 to 265 miles of range. The Nissan Leaf is another example of a BEV.\n\n**Brake Assist**\n\nAn ADAS system that automatically applies full braking power when it detects that the driver is executing a panic stop.\n\n**Brake caliper**\n\nThe hydraulic assembly that contains the brake pads and applies them against the brake rotor to slow or stop the car.\n\n**Brake fluid**\n\nThe liquid in the brake system that acts as a hydraulic fluid. As you step on the brake pedal, brake fluid is forced through the system to apply the brake assemblies at the wheels.\n\n**Brake fluid reservoir**\n\nThe container that stores a supply of brake fluid until it is needed. On most vehicles, the reservoir is attached to the brake master cylinder.\n\n**Brake master cylinder**\n\nThe brake system component that turns the mechanical power provided when you step on the brake pedal into the hydraulic power that is needed to apply the brakes and slow or stop the vehicle.\n\n**Chassis (undercarriage)**\n\nThe vehicle frame that carries all suspension and power train components. Trucks still use a frame that is separate from the body, but virtually all modern passenger cars use unit-body construction in which the body itself serves as the main chassis member.\n\n**Crank**\n\nThe car “cranks” when the starter motor is able to spin the engine or cause it to “turn over.” If the car “will not crank” when you turn the ignition key, you hear either a clicking sound, or nothing at all. The term “crank” is also used as a short form of the word crankshaft.\n\n**Crankcase (engine block)**\n\nLargest assembly of an internal combustion engine. Consists of the lower part of the engine which contains the crankshaft, connecting rods and pistons in an oil-tight housing.\n\n**Daytime Running Lights (DRL)**\n\nFront lighting designed to operate during daylight hours to improve a vehicle’s visibility to other drivers. DRLs may be normal-intensity headlights, reduced-intensity headlights or separate lighting assemblies that may include LED arrays.\n\n**Differential**\n\nA system of gears that allows the outside driven wheel to rotate faster than the inside driven wheel when turning a corner. Conventional “open” differentials direct engine power to the wheel with the least traction, which can be a problem on slippery surfaces. To combat this, some vehicles are equipped with “limited-slip” differentials that ensure some power is always delivered to both driven wheels.\n\n**Drivetrain (powertrain)**\n\nThe combination of the engine, transmission, driveshaft, differential and axles that deliver power to the wheels.\n\n**Grab**\n\nBrakes engage suddenly and strongly, even when applying light pressure on the brake pedal.\n\n**High Intensity Discharge (HID) headlights**\n\nHeadlights that use high voltage to ionize a mix of gases, including xenon, in a special bulb to produce an extra-white or even bluish light that is several times brighter than a conventional halogen headlight.\n\n**Knocking (detonation, pinging)**\n\nRapid, uncontrolled combustion of the air-fuel mixture in the cylinder that results in a hard, rattling sound. Detonation can cause severe engine damage if left unchecked for long.\n\n**Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV)**\n\nSimilar to a conventional hybrid electric vehicle, a PHEV has a larger battery that can be charged by plugging the car into an external power source. PHEVs have an electric-only range of around 10-20 miles. Once that range is exhausted, the vehicle reverts to normal hybrid operation with a gasoline engine that drives the car and combines with regenerative braking to charge the battery for a limited amount of electrical power assist. The Toyota Prius Plug-in is an example of a PHEV.\n\n**Shock absorber**\n\nSuspension component that damps spring oscillations. Shock absorbers work by forcing a fluid through calibrated orifices that limit the rate of movement. Some designs place the fluid under gas pressure to prevent or reduce fluid foaming which can greatly reduce efficiency.\n\n**Sidewall**\n\nThe most visible part of the tire when viewing the vehicle from either side. The sidewall contains information about the tire size, grade, and ratings as well as the manufacturer's name.\n\n**Strut (MacPherson strut)**\n\nA type of shock absorber that also serves as a suspension locating member. Most struts incorporate the suspension spring around their shaft, a design called the MacPherson strut. A “modified strut” mounts the spring separately from the strut.\n\n**Supercharger**\n\nAn engine driven compressor that forces additional air into the engine, allowing more fuel to be burned for greater power output.\n\n**Telematics**\n\nThe wireless transmission of useful information to and from a vehicle.\n\n**Wheel (rim)**\n\nWhat the tire is mounted on. Wheels can be made of steel or a light alloy, such as aluminum.\n\nPage 1 of 5\n"""

A column that has a nested table as a value or multiple values is not in 1NF.\n\n## 2\n\n**2NF**\n\n2NF, or second normal form, describes a type of database normalization that: 1) satisfies the requirements of 1NF, 2) has no values that are tied directly to a subset of a candidate key. In other words, a relation is in 2NF if it is in 1NF and all of the non-candidate values are dependent on the composite key in whole, not just a portion of the candidate key. For example, a \\`book\\` table that has a candidate key composed of \\`title\\` and \\`author\\` cannot be in 2NF if it also includes a \\`dob\\` field describing the author's date of birth. That column value is dependent only on the value of \\`author\\` and could lead to inconsistencies if the values get out of sync.\n\n## 3\n\n**3NF**\n\n3NF, or third normal form, describes a type of database normalization that: 1) satisfies the requirements of 2NF, 2) each non-key attribute is not transitively dependent on a key attribute. For example, if a \\`user\\` table has a \\`user_id\\` column as a primary key, a \\`user_city\\` column, and a \\`user_state\\` column, it would not be in 3NF because \\`user_state\\` is transitively dependent on \\`user_id\\` through \\`user_city\\` (the city and state should be extracted to their own table and referenced together).\n\n## 4\n\n**4NF**\n\n4NF, or fourth normal form, describes a type of database normalization that: 1) satisfies the requirements of BCNF, 2) for every non-trivial multivalued dependency, the determining attribute in the dependency is either a candidate key or a superset of it. In other words, if a field has multiple dependent fields that are independent from one another, it can lead to redundancies that violate 4NF rules.\n\n## A\n\n**Anti-caching**\n\nAnti-caching is a strategy that can be used when data is not found in the faster in-memory cache and must be retrieved from slower, persistent storage. The technique involves aborting the transaction and kicking off an asynchronous operation to fetch the data from the slower medium to memory. The transaction can be retried later and the information will be ready to served from memory.\n\n**Atomicity**\n\nAtomicity is a quality mainly associated with database transactions that means that the operations encapsulated in the transaction are handled in an all-or-nothing fashion. This prevents partial updates from occurring where some operations were performed before an error condition arose, leading to inconsistent data. In the case of transactions, either all of the operations are committed or every operation is rolled back to leave the database in the same state that it was in when the transaction began.\n\n**Availability**\n\nAvailability is a property that describes the degree to which a system is running and capable of performing work. In terms of computing systems like databases, for a single machine, availability is synonymous with the uptime of the application on that computer. For distributed systems, availability is subject to rules that dictate in what capacity the system is allowed to continue functioning if a subset of the system is unavailable.\n\n## B\n\n**Blue-green deployments**\n\nBlue-green deployments are a technique for deploying software updates with little to no downtime by managing active traffic between two identical sets of infrastructure. New releases can be deployed to the inactive infrastructure group and tested independently. To release the new version, a traffic routing mechanism is switched to direct traffic from the current infrastructure to the infrastructure with the new version. The previously-active infrastructure now functions as the target for the next updates. This strategy is helpful in that the routing mechanism can easily switch back and forth to roll backwards or forwards depending on the success of a deployment.\n\n## C\n\n**Cache**\n\nA cache is a component of a system designed to allow faster retrieval for high value or frequently requested pieces of data. In general, caches function by storing a useful fraction of data on media that is either higher performance or closer to the client than the general use persistent media focused on long term, non-volatile storage. In general, caches tend to be higher performance but tend to have more limited capacity and be more expensive.\n\n**Cache-aside**\n\nCache-aside is a caching architecture that positions the cache outside of the regular path between application and database. In this arrangement, the application will fetch data from the cache if it is available there. If the data is not in the cache, the application will issue a separate query to the original data source to fetch the data and then write that data to the cache for subsequent queries. The minimal crossover between the cache and backing data source allows this architecture to be resilient against unavailable caches. Cache-aside is well-suited for read-heavy workloads.\n\n## C\n\n**Canary releases**\n\nA canary release describes a release strategy where new versions of software are deployed to a small subset of servers to test new changes in an environment with limited impact. The deployment and resulting behavior of the test group are observed and the team can then decide if they want to roll back the changes or continue to deploy the changes to a wider range of hosts. Canary releases are a way of testing in production while limiting the number of clients impacted by any problems.\n\n**CAP theorem**\n\nCAP theorem is a statement about distributed databases that states that any system can only provide at most two out of the following three qualities: consistency, availability, and partition tolerance. Generally, it is agreed that partition tolerance must be a feature of any distributed system (as the only way to avoid all network partitions is to have a non-distributed system). Therefore, each distributed system must make a decision as to whether they want to prioritize data consistency (by not accepting new changes in the case of a partition) or system availability (by sacrificing some consistency for the sake of still being able to introduce new changes during the partition).\n\n**Cassandra**\n\nApache Cassandra is a distributed, wide-column NoSQL database focused on operating on and managing large volumes of data. Cassandra scales incredibly well and each node in the cluster can accept reads or writes. Data is stored in rows that are uniquely identifiable and partitioned based on partition key. Each partition key returns a row of data with both column names and values defined internally, meaning each row in the same column family may contain different columns.\n\n**Column family**\n\nA column family is a database object that stores groups of key-value pairs where each key is a row identifier and each value is a group of column names and values. All together, a column family constructs something that is akin to a table in relational databases. However, each row can define its own columns, meaning that rows are of varying lengths and do not have to match each other in the columns represented or the data types stored.\n\n**Command query responsibility segregation**\n\nCommand query responsibility segregation is a application design pattern that allows you to separate operations based on their impact on the underlying database. In general, this usually means providing different mechanisms for queries that read data versus queries that change data. Separating these two contexts allows you to make infrastructure and system changes to scale each use-case independently, increasing performance.\n\n**Cursor**\n\nA database cursor is a way for clients to iterate over records and query results in a controlled, precise manner. Cursors are primarily used to page through results that match a query one-by-one by iteratively returning the next row for processing. This can help you operate on an unknown number of records by accessing the results as a queue. Care must be taken when using cursors as they take up resources on the database system, can result in locking, and often result in many more network round trips than would be required otherwise.\n\n## D\n\n**Dark launching**\n\nDark launching is a deployment and release strategy that helps organizations test new changes in production contexts without affecting the user experience. Dark launching involves releasing new code in parallel to the original functionality. Requests and actions are then mirrored and run against both the old code and the new code. While the system's behavior from the user's perspective is only affected by the original code, the new code can be tested with real data to validate functionality and catch performance and functional problems. When properly vetted, the application can be altered to use the new code path exclusively.\n\n**Data definition language (DDL)**\n\nA data definition language, or DDL, is a set of commands or actions that are used to define database structures and objects. They are a key component to relational and other databases and are expressed as a subset of the available commands available to manage data in languages like SQL. Data definition language is the portion of the language dedicated to describing, creating, and modifying structures and the frameworks that will hold data.\n\n**Database management system (DBMS)**\n\nA database management system, often called a DBMS or even just a \""database\"", is an application responsible for organizing and managing data. DBMSs can follow many different paradigms and prioritize certain goals. Generally, at the very least, they are responsible for persisting data, organizing and categorizing data, and ingesting, manipulating, and querying data. Most often, DBMSs offer a client / server model where the server is responsible for controlling and managing the data while clients, libraries, or APIs can be used to interact with the server to add or query data, change data structures, or manage other aspects of the system.\n\n**Denormalization**\n\nDenormalization is a process where the data and structure within a database is \""denormalized\"" or taken out of a normalized state. This can happen accidentally if a data structure that is intended to be normalized is ill defined or mismanaged. However, it is often also performed intentionally in certain scenarios. Denormalization tends to allow faster access to data by storing values redundantly in different places. The drawback of this is that write performance suffers and there is a possibility that data can get out of sync since multiple locations are used to represent the same data.\n\n## E\n\n**Encoding**\n\nEncoding is a system that translates between a character system that can represents the components used in written language and a digital representation that the computer can store and operate on. Different encoding systems have been developed with a wide variety of character ranges. Some are targeted at specific languages or language families (like ASCII) while others attempt to provide representation for much larger character sets appropriate for different many languages (like the UTF unicode varieties).\n\n## H\n\n**HTAP database**\n\nHTAP databases, or hybrid transactional/analytical databases, are a category of database that seeks to offer the advantages of both fast, reliable transactional processing and the ability to process heavy, complex analytical workloads concurrently on the same machine. Rather than analyzing data after the fact, these database offerings attempt to allow real time analysis that can impact the way decisions are made rapidly.\n\n## I\n\n**Index**\n\nA database index is a structure that is created to allow for faster record finding within a table. An index allows the database system to look up data efficiently by keeping a separate structure for the values of specific columns. Queries that target the indexed columns can identify applicable rows in the table quickly by using a more efficient lookup strategy than checking each row line by line. Indexed columns improve read operations but do add overhead to write operations since both the table and the index must be updated. It is important to balance these two considerations when designing table indexes.\n\n## M\n\n**Microservice architecture**\n\nThe microservices architecture is an application and service design that affects the development, deployment, and operation of the components. The microservices approach decomposes an application's functionality and implements each responsibility as a discrete service. Rather than internal function calls, the service communicates over the network using clearly defined interfaces. Microservices are often used to help speed up development as each component can be coded and iterated on independently. It also helps with scalability as each service can be scaled as needed, often with the help of service orchestration software.\n\n**MongoDB**\n\nMongoDB is the most popular document-oriented NoSQL database system in use today. It stores data using JSON-like structures that can be specified at the time of data storage. Each document can have its own structure with as much or as little complexity as required. MongoDB provides a non-SQL methods and commands to manage and query data programmatically or interactively. MongoDB is known for its fast performance, scalability, and for enabling a rapid development pace.\n\n## N\n\n**Node**\n\nIn databases, a node often refers to a single instance of a database. The term node is often used when talking about the infrastructure architecture of distributed databases where multiple servers may be involved in processing a request.\n\n## O\n\n**OLTP database**\n\nAn OLTP database, or Online Transaction Processing database, is a database system primarily designed to facilitate fast, near real time database tasks. Typically, OLTP databases are used with applications where multiple clients may be accessing the data at a single time and where quick response times are required. OLTP databases are optimized for reliability and processing speed.\n\n## P\n\n**Persistent storage**\n\nPersistent storage refers to any storage medium that is able to maintain data after the system loses power or is disconnected. Persistent storage is required to maintain a more permanent repository of data. Often, persistent storage is slower than ephemeral storage like in-memory data, so database systems use a variety of processes to shuttle data between the two storage systems as needed to take advantage of and balance the disadvantages of both types.\n\n**Precision (searching)**\n\nIn the context of search performance, precision is a measure of how relevant the retrieved results are to the given query. Specifically, search precision is defined as the ratio between the number of relevant results out of all of the results that were returned. A query with a high level of precision does not retrieve many items that are not applicable to the query.\n\n**Primary key**\n\nA primary key is a type of database key that is designated as the main way to uniquely address a database row. While other keys may be able to pull individual rows, the primary key is specifically marked for this purpose with the system enforcing uniqueness and not \\`NULL\\` consistency checks. A primary key can be a natural key (a key that is naturally unique across records) or a surrogate key (a key added specifically to serve as a primary key) and can be formed from a single or multiple columns.\n\n## Q\n\n**Query**\n\nIn databases, a query is a formatted command used to make a request to a database management system using a query language. The database system processes the query to understand what actions to take and what data to return to the client. Often, queries are used to request data matching specific patterns, insert new data into an existing structure, or modify and save changes to existing records. In addition to targeting data items, queries can often manipulate items like table structures and the server settings, making them the general administrative interface for the system. SQL, or Structured Query Language, is the most common database querying language used with relational databases.\n\n**Query builder**\n\nA query builder is a database abstraction used in application development to make programming against databases easier. Similar to an ORM, a query builder provides an interface for working with a database system from within the application. However, instead of attempting to map application objects to database records directly, query builders focus on providing native functions and methods that translate closely to the database operations. This allows you to build queries programmatically in a safer and more flexible way than working with SQL (or other database language) strings directly.\n\n**Query language**\n\nA query language is a type of programming language that specializes in searching for, retrieving, and manipulating data in databases. SQL, or Structured Query Language, is the most common querying language in the world and is used primarily to manage data within relational database systems. Query language operations can be categorized based on the focus and target of the procedure into Data Definition Language (DDL) when they are used to define data structures, Data Control Language (DCL) when they are used for system management tasks, and Data Manipulation Language (DML) when they are used to modify data.\n\n## R\n\n**Record**\n\nIn databases, a record is a group of data usually representing a single entity. In relational databases, a record is synonymous with a row in a table. Each record may have multiple pieces of data or attributes associated with it (these would be fields in a relational table).\n\n## S\n\n**Shard**\n\nA database shard is a segment of records stored by a database object that is separated out and managed by a different database node for performance reasons. For example, a database table with 9 million records could be divided into three separate shards, each managing 3 million records. The data is typically divided according to a \""shard key\"" which is a key that determines which shard a record should be managed by. Each shard manages its subset of records and a coordinating component is required to direct client queries to the appropriate shard by referring to the shard key. Sharding can help some types of performance in very large datasets but it often requires making trade-offs that might degrade other types of performance (for instance, on operations that need to coordinate between multiple shards).\n\n**SQL**\n\nSQL, or Structured Query Language, is the most common database querying language in use today. It is primarily used to work with relational data and allows users to create queries to select, filter, define, and manipulate the data within relational databases. While SQL is a common standard, implementation details differ widely, making it less software agnostic than hoped.\n\n## T\n\n**Table aliases**\n\nA table alias is name given at query time for an existing or calculated table or table-like database object. Table aliases can be useful if the original name is long or ambiguous or if the table is generated by the query itself and requires a label to refer back to it in other parts of the query or for display.\n\n**Transaction**\n\nA database transaction is a set of operations combined into a single unit that can be executed by a database system atomically. Transactions ensure that all of the operations within them are successfully completed or that they are all rolled back to return to the starting state.

In other words, a relation is in 2NF if it is in 1NF and all of the non-candidate values are dependent on the composite key in whole, not just a portion of the candidate key. For example, a \\`book\\` table that has a candidate key composed of \\`title\\` and \\`author\\` cannot be in 2NF if it also includes a \\`dob\\` field describing the author's date of birth. That column value is dependent only on the value of \\`author\\` and could lead to inconsistencies if the values get out of sync.\n\n## A\n\n**Active record ORM**\n\nAn active record ORM is an object-relational mapper that functions by trying to represent each table in a database as a class in the application. Each record in the table is represented as an instance of the class. Database entries are added and managed by interacting with these representations in the application.\n\n**Anti-caching**\n\nAnti-caching is a strategy that can be used when data is not found in the faster in-memory cache and must be retrieved from slower, persistent storage. The technique involves aborting the transaction and kicking off an asynchronous operation to fetch the data from the slower medium to memory. The transaction can be retried later and the information will be ready to served from memory.\n\n**Authorization**\n\nAuthorization is an action that determines if a certain user or process should be allowed to perform a certain action. Authorization involves checking the requested action against a set of guidelines that describe who should be allowed perform what actions. Authorization usually relies on a trusted authentication process to take place before the request in order to confirm the subject's identity.\n\n## C\n\n**Cache**\n\nA cache is a component of a system designed to allow faster retrieval for high value or frequently requested pieces of data. In general, caches function by storing a useful fraction of data on media that is either higher performance or closer to the client than the general use persistent media focused on long term, non-volatile storage. In general, caches tend to be higher performance but tend to have more limited capacity and be more expensive.\n\n**Canary releases**\n\nA canary release describes a release strategy where new versions of software are deployed to a small subset of servers to test new changes in an environment with limited impact. The deployment and resulting behavior of the test group are observed and the team can then decide if they want to roll back the changes or continue to deploy the changes to a wider range of hosts. Canary releases are a way of testing in production while limiting the number of clients impacted by any problems.\n\n**Check constraint**\n\nA check constraint is perhaps the most flexible table or column constraint that can be added to a relational database. It is defined as a boolean condition that must be met for the proposed data to be accepted by the system. Because of the nature of the condition is fairly open-ended, check constraints can be used to model many different types of requirements to ensure that the data coming into the system conforms to expectations.\n\n**Cluster**\n\nIn computing, a cluster is a group of computers all dedicated to helping with a shared task. Database clusters are used to increase the capacity, availability, and performance of certain types of actions compared to database deployed on a single computer. There are many different topologies, technologies, and trade-offs that different clustered systems employ to achieve different levels of performance or fault tolerance. Because of the diversity of different implementations, it can be difficult to generalize specific characteristics that apply to all clustered database systems.\n\n## C\n\n**Column**\n\nColumns are a component of table-oriented databases that label and potentially define the type of each value stored in that column. In traditional relational databases, the properties of a series of columns are one of the primary ways of defining the properties of the table in general. Each row added to the table must provide values that conform to the requirements associated with the table's columns. In non-relational databases, columns can have many different properties. Generally, however, they are used to label and define the characteristics for values that records choose to store in that column.\n\n**Constraint**\n\nA constraint is a limitation imposed on a specific column or table that impacts the range of values accepted by the system. Constraints are used to define rules that the database system can enforce to ensure that values conform to requirements.\n\n## D\n\n**Dirty read**\n\nA dirty read is a specific type of anomaly that can occur where one transaction can read data that hasn't been committed by another transaction. If the second transaction is rolled back instead of committed, the first transaction will be using a value that doesn't reflect the actual state of the database. Dirty reads are possible at certain isolation levels for transactions and represent a risk that can lead to inconsistency when manipulating data in parallel.\n\n## E\n\n**Expand and contract pattern**\n\nThe expand and contract pattern is a strategy for introducing new changes to a database schema without affecting existing applications. It works by introducing changes in carefully controlled stages by first adding new or changed structures alongside existing structures and then expanding the application logic to use both structures simultaneously. Eventually, after testing, the application can stop writing to original structure and it can be removed.\n\n## F\n\n**Full-text search**\n\nFull-text search describes a family of techniques and functionality that allow you to search the complete text of documents within a database system. This is in direct opposition to search functionality that relies only on metadata, partial text sources, and other incomplete assessments. Full-text search relies on asynchronous indexing using natural language-aware parsers to analyze and categorize text within documents.\n\n## H\n\n**Hierarchical database**\n\nA hierarchical database is a database model that organizes itself into a tree-like structure. Each new record is attached to a single parent record. As records are added to the database, a tree-like structure emerges as records fan out more and more from the root record. The links between records can be traversed to get to other records. Examples of systems that use a hierarchical model include LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) and DNS (Domain Name System).\n\n**Hot backup**\n\nA hot backup is a backup of a database system while it is actively in use. They are often preferable, if possible, because they do not require the database system to be taken offline to perform the operation. Hot backups are not always possible as they can require locking certain parts of the database or can reduce the IOPS (Input / Output Operations per Second) available for normal database tasks.\n\n## M\n\n**Multiversion concurrency control (MVCC)**\n\nMultiversion concurrency control, or MVCC, is a strategy for allowing concurrent access to data within database systems as an alternative to row and table locking. MVCC works by taking \""snapshots\"" that represent a consistent data state for each user accessing a set of data. The goal of MVCC is to offer a system where read queries never block write queries and where write queries never block read queries. Each client will be able to read and use the data as if they were the only user while the database system tracks multiple versions of the data being read and updated by each user. Locking or the normal transaction rollback and conflict management strategies are used to resolve disputes caused by updating the same data.\n\n## N\n\n**Normalization**\n\nDatabase normalization is a process of structuring a database to remove data redundancy and eliminate opportunities for inconsistencies to be introduced. Normalization is often discussed in terms of \""normal forms\"" where each form adds additional checks and guarantees over the previous forms. In practice, data normalization is often a trade-off between data integrity guarantees and performance, so structures often are not put into the highest level of normalization possible.\n\n## R\n\n**Repeatable read isolation level**\n\nThe repeatable read isolation level is a transaction isolation level for relational database systems that offers better isolation than read committed level, but not as much isolation of the serializable level. At the repeatable read isolation level, dirty reads and nonrepeatable reads are both prevented. However, phantom reads and serialization anomalies can still occur. This means that while reads of individual records are guaranteed to remain stable, range queries (like \\`SELECT\\` statements that return multiple rows) can change as a result of commits outside of the transaction.\n\n**Replication**\n\nReplication is a process of continually copying and updating data from one system to another system. In databases, this typically involves a server sharing a log of changes that other servers can read and apply to their own copies of the data. This allows changes to propagate between various servers without requiring each server to approve operations at the time of execution. Many types of replication exists that differ in terms of method of sharing, the architecture of which systems copy data from where, and what policies are in place to control the replication process. Replication is an important feature in many systems for maintaining data availability, distributing load, and providing copies of data for offline procedures like backups.\n\n## S\n\n**Sanitizing input**\n\nSanitizing input, also known as input validation, is a process used to render user-provided values safe for further processing. It is used to guard against malicious input that can cause an application or the database to misinterpret data values as valid application or query code. Inputs can be sanitized in a number of different ways like limiting the list of valid characters, removing characters that have special meaning for the systems in use, and escaping values. Generally speaking, instead of sanitizing input, it is considered much safer to use prepared statements.\n\n**Scaling**\n\nScaling is the process of expanding the resources allocated to your application or workload to allow for better performance or to handle more concurrent activity. Scaling strategies generally fall into two categories: scaling out (also called horizontal scaling) and scaling up (also known as vertical scaling). Horizontal scaling involves adding additional workers to a pool that can handle the incoming work. This often means adding additional servers that can all perform the same operations, thus distributing the load. Scaling up involves adding additional resources like processors, RAM, or storage to the server already handling requests. Scaling allows you to handle more concurrent operations but it can potentially increase the complexity of your application architecture.\n\n**Shard**\n\nA database shard is a segment of records stored by a database object that is separated out and managed by a different database node for performance reasons. For example, a database table with 9 million records could be divided into three separate shards, each managing 3 million records. The data is typically divided according to a \""shard key\"" which is a key that determines which shard a record should be managed by. Each shard manages its subset of records and a coordinating component is required to direct client queries to the appropriate shard by referring to the shard key. Sharding can help some types of performance in very large datasets but it often requires making trade-offs that might degrade other types of performance (for instance, on operations that need to coordinate between multiple shards).\n\n**Standard column family**\n\nA standard column family is a type of column family database object that stores data by defining row keys that are associated with key value pairs akin to columns. Each row can define and use its own columns, so the resulting dataset is not regular as with relational database tables. However, the row keys combined with column labels and values still somewhat resembles a table. Standard column families offer good performance for key-based data retrieval as they are able to store all of the information associated with a key in the same place and can modify the data structure for that key easily.\n\n**Superkey**\n\nA superkey is any set of attributes within the relational database model that can be used to uniquely identify a record. All other key types (primary keys, candidate keys, composite keys, etc.) are examples of super keys. A trivial superkey contains all available attributes, while a candidate key is any superkey that cannot be simplified by removing additional columns.\n\n## T\n\n**Table**\n\nIn relational databases, a table is a database structure that defines different attributes in the form of columns and stores records with the associated column values in the form of rows. The constraints and data types defined by a table's columns as well as additional table-level requirements describe the type of data that can be stored within the table. Since tables are a regular data structure, the database system understands the shape of the data contained within, which can help make query performance more predictable in some cases.\n\n**Transaction**\n\nA database transaction is a set of operations combined into a single unit that can be executed by a database system atomically. Transactions ensure that all of the operations within them are successfully completed or that they are all rolled back to return to the starting state. This helps preserve data integrity and allows for isolation between different unrelated actions that clients may make within a database. The guarantees provided by database transactions are summarized by the ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability) properties.\n\n## V\n\n**Vertices**\n\nIn graph databases, vertices are entities that can hold properties and be connected to other vertices through edges. Vertices are similar to a record or a document in other database systems as they have a label or name to indicate the type of object they represent and they have attributes that provide specific additional information to differentiate a specific vertex from others of its type. Vertices are connected to other vertices through edges that define a relationship between them. For instance, an \""author\"" vertex can be connected to a \""book\"" vertex with a \""written by\"" edge.\n\n## W\n\n**Weight (search)**\n\nIn the context of searching, a search weight is an arbitrary value assigned to different categories of data designed to influence the priority of the item when analyzed for relevance. Assigning a heavy weight to a specific type of information will cause a query engine to assign greater significance to that category compared to other categories when compiling a list of relevant results.\n\n**Write operation**\n\nIn the context of databases, a write operation is any database action that modifies the stored data. This includes inserting new records, deleting records, and updating existing records to new values.\n\n**Write-ahead logging (WAL)**\n\nWrite-ahead logging, or WAL, is an approach to data revision management that increases the resiliency of systems data corruption during crashes and failures. Without a technique like WAL, corruption can occur if the system crashes when a change to a database is only partially completed. In this case, the data will be in neither the initial nor the intended state. With write ahead logging, the system records its intentions to a durable write ahead log before executing operations. This way, the database can recover a known-good state of the data by reviewing the log during recovery and redoing any operations that did not complete correctly initially.\n\nPage 4 of 5\n"""
